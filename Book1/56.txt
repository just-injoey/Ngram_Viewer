TO 
DADABHAI NAOROJI, ESQ., M.P. 
LONDON 
SIR, 
Though the Government is silent, the papers have been in-
forming the public that the Franchise Bill has been disallowed 
by Her Majesty. Can you give us any information on the point? 
The Indian settlers cannot thank you and the Congress Com-
mittee too much for the trouble taken on their behalf. 
I remain, 
Sir, 
Your faithful servant, 
M. 
K. GANDHI 
[PS.] 
I venture to send the enclosed for perusal. 
M. K. G.
