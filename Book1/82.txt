HUMBLY SHEWETH THAT: 
Your Excellency's Memorialists, as representing the Indian 
community in Natal, hereby respectfully beg to approach Your 
Excellency with regard to the following portions of Rules and 
Regulations for the disposal of erven1 in the Township of Nond-
weni, Zululand, published in the Natal Government Gazette, dated 
the 25th February 1896, viz.: 
Part of Section 4: Persons of European birth or descent intending to 
bid at any such sale must give notice in writing at least twenty days 
prior to the date fixed for the sale to the Secretary for Zululand, Pieter-
maritzburg, or to the Government Secretary at Eshowe, Zululand, describ-
ing as far as practicable by numbers or otherwise the erven they are desirous 
of acquiring.

Part of Section 18: Only persons of European birth or descent shall 
be approved of as occupiers of erven or sites. On failure of compliance with 
the condition any such sites or erven shall revert to the Government as in 
the preceding section hereof. 
Rule 20: It shall be a distinct condition subject to which the erven 
or sites are sold, and which condition shall be inserted in every freehold 
title applied for and issued in terms of Sections 10, 11 and 13 of these 
Regulations, that at no time shall the owner of sites or erven in the Non-
dweni Township bought hereunder be at liberty either to sell or let such 
sites or erven or any portion thereof or to permit occupation of them or 
any portion thereof free of rent to any other persons except those of Euro-
pean birth and descent, and in the event of the holder of such title-deed 
contravening such conditions and stipulations, any such sites or erven 
shall revert to the Government in terms and manner stated in Section 
17 hereof. 
Your Memorialists interpret the rules to mean exclusion of 
Her Majesty's Indian subjects from owning or acquiring property 
in the Nondweni Township. 
Your Memorialists beg respectfully but emphatically to pro-
test against the invidious distinction thus drawn between Euro-
pean and Indian British subjects. 
Nor can your Memorialists find any reason for such exclu-
sion, unless it be another point among many yielded to the colour 
prejudice in South Africa. 
Your Memorialists humbly submit that such preference given 
to one portion of Her Majesty's subjects over another is not only 
contrary to the British policy and justice, but, in the case of the 
Indian community, violates the terms of the Proclamation of 1858 
which entitles British Indians to equal treatment with the Euro-
peans. 
Your Memorialists venture further to submit that, in view 
of the efforts of Her Majesty's Government on behalf of the 
Indians residing in the Transvaal, the distinction drawn by the 
rules under discussion with regard to property rights is somewhat 
strange and inconsistent. 
Your Memorialists would crave leave to mention that many 
Indians own freehold property in other parts of Zululand. 
Your Memorialists, therefore, humbly pray that, in virtue 
of the power reserved by Section 23 of the Regulations, Your 
Excellency will be pleased to order such alteration or amendment 
thereof as to do away with the above-mentioned distinction.

And for this act of justice and mercy, your Memorialists, as 
in duty bound, shall for ever pray, etc., etc.1
