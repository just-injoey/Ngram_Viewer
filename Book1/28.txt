WELCOME ADDRESS TO NEW GOVERNOR 
TOWN HALL, 
DURBAN, 
September 28, 1893 
TO 
HIS EXCELLENCY, 
SIR WALTER HELY-HUTCHINSON, K.C.M.G., ETC. 
MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 
We, the undersigned 
members of the 
Mahomedan 
and 
Indian community of the Colony of Natal, beg most respectfully 
to welcome Your Excellency on the occasion of Your Excellency's 
arrival here as the representative of Her Majesty the Queen, 
Empress of India. 
We trust that Your Excellency will find the Colony and its 
associations congenial, and that the task of introducing a new 
form of government into Natal will be as free from difficulty as 
it will be pregnant with interest. 
The special affairs of the Indian community in Natal will, 
owing to the extending Indian influence here, constantly occupy 
Your Excellency's attention; and we bespeak, with Your Ex-
cellency's permission, that consideration towards our community, 
which, we are confident, Your Excellency, representing Her Most 
Gracious Majesty, will be pleased to grant to us. 
We take leave to wish for Your Excellency and Lady Hely-
Hutchinson all prosperity during your stay in this country. And 
we are, 
Your Excellency's most obedient servants,
