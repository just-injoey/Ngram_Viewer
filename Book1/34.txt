VEGETARIANISM AND CHILDREN 
Mr. M. K. Gandhi, in a private letter, writes: 
Recently a grand convention of Keswick Christians was 
held in Wellington, under the presidency of Rev. Andrew Mur-
ray. I attended it in the company of some dear Christians; they 
have a boy six or seven years old. He came out with me for a walk 
one day during the time. I was simply talking to him about kind-
ness to animals. During the talk we discussed vegetarianism. Ever 
since that time, I am told, the boy has not taken meat. He did 
watch me, before the above conversation, taking only vegetables 
at the dinner table, and questioned me why I would not take 
meat. His parents, though not themselves vegetarians, are believ-
ers in the virtue of vegetarianism, and did not mind my talking 
to their boy about it.

I write this to show how easily you can convince children of 
the grand truth, and induce them to avoid meat if their parents are 
not against the change. The boy and I are thick friends now. He 
seems to like me very much. 
Another boy, about 15, I was talking to, said he could not 
himself kill or see a fowl killed, but did not object to eating it.
