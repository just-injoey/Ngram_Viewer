93. LETTER TO C. BIRD 
DURBAN, 
May 18, 1896 
C. BIRD, ESQ. 
PRINCIPAL UNDER-SECRETARY 
COLONIAL OFFICE 
PIETERMARITZBURG 
SIR, 
I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter 2837/96, dated 
the 16th instant, in reply to my letter to the Honourable the Prime 
Minister with reference to the Natal Indian Congress. 
I beg to state with regard to the matter that the Congress 
meetings are held always with open doors, and they are open to 
the Press and public. Certain European gentlemen who, the Con-
gress members thought, might be interested in the meetings, were 
specially invited. 
One gentleman did accept the invitation and 
attend a Congress meeting. Uninvited European visitors also have 
attended the Congress meetings once or twice. 
One of the Congress rules provides that Europeans may be 
invited to become Vice-Presidents. According thereto, two gentle-
men were asked if they would accept the honour, but they were 
not disposed to do so. 
Minutes of the Congress proceedings are 
regularly kept.1 
I beg to remain, 
Sir, 
Your obedient servant, 
M. K. GANDHI 
HONORARY SECRETARY 
NATAL INDIAN CONGRESS 
From a copy: S.N. 983 
1 Referring to this letter, Sir John Robinson said in Parliament that he 
had no explanation to offer and furnished a gist of the correspondence.
