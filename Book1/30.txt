WORK FOR VEGETARIANISM 
Mr. M. K. Gandhi, in a private letter from Pretoria, writes: 
There is a very fine opportunity in South Africa for a vege-
tarian gardener. 
Cultivation is very much neglected though the 
soil is very fruitful. 
I am glad to say I have been able to induce my land-lady, 
who is an Englishwoman, to become a vegetarian, and bring up 
her children on a vegetarian diet, but I am afraid she will slide 
down. Proper vegetables cannot be had here. Such as can be had 
are very dear. Fruit, too, is very dear; so is also milk. It there-
fore becomes very difficult to give her a sufficient variety. She would 
certainly leave it off if she finds it more expensive. 
I was very much interested in Mr. Hills's article on vital 
food.1 I intend giving it another trial very soon. You will re-
collect that I did give it a trial when in Bombay, but not for a 
time long enough to warrant any opinion about it. 
Kindly remember me to all our friends. 
The Vegetarian, 30-9-1893 
1 The theory of vital food was originally propagated by Mr. A. F. Hills, 
Chairman of the Vegetarian Society, at its first quarterly meeting on February 
4, 1889. In The First Diet of Paradise, he expounded, at some length, a some-
what remarkable theory of vitality, energy, rays of the sun, etc., which were 
to be found in the following foods: fruit, grain, nuts and pulse, all raw. Vide 
also "An Experiment in Vital Food", 24-3-1894.
