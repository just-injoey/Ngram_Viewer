DURBAN,

TO 
HIS 
EXCELLENCY 
THE 
HONOURABLE 
SIR 
WALTER 
FRANCIS 
HELY-HUTCHINSON, 
K.C.M.G., 
GOVERNOR 
AND 
COMMANDER-IN-
CHIEF 
IN

VICE-ADMIRAL

AND 
SUPREME 
CHIEF 
OVER 
THE 
NATIVE 
POPULATION 
MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 
At a meeting held on the 1st July, 1894, of leading Indians 
in Durban, we were requested to await Your Excellency's pleasure 
1 Enclosure No. 2 in Despatch No. 62 of July 16, 
1894 from the 
Governor of Natal, Sir Waiter Hely-Hutchinson, to Lord Ripon, Secretary of 
State for the Colonies 
DEPUTATION TO NATAL GOVERNOR 
137 
with regard to the Franchise Law Amendment Bill, which was 
read a third time last evening in the Honourable the Legislative 
Assembly of the Colony of Natal. 
The Bill as it stands disqualifies every Indian, whether a British 
subject or not, not already on the Voters' List, from becoming a 
voter. 
We venture to say that, without any further qualification, 
the Bill is manifestly unjust, and would work very harshly at any 
rate upon some Indians. 
Even in England, any British subject having the proper 
qualifications is entitled to vote, irrespective of caste, colour, or 
creed. 
We would not deal at length with the question here lest we 
should trespass too much upon Your Excellency's courtesy, but 
would beg leave to present Your Excellency with a printed copy of 
the petition addressed to the Honourable Assembly and request 
Your Excellency to peruse it carefully. 
To us our cause seems to be so just that it should not need 
any arguments to support it. 
We trust that Your 
Excellency, 
representing Her Most 
Gracious Majesty the Queen Empress, will not sanction a mea-
sure that would seem to lay down that an Indian British subject 
of Her Majesty can never become fit to exercise the franchise. 
We hope to send a proper petition1 
to Your Excellency 
through the regular channels about the matter. 
We thank Your Excellency very much for granting the depu-
tation an interview in Durban and for Your Excellency's cour-
tesy and patience. 
We have, etc., 
M. 
K. GANDHI 
AND SIX OTHERS 
Colonial Office Records No. 179, Vol. 189 
1 No further petition to the Governor of Natal was, in fact, sent. 
Evidently Gandhiji and his associates intended to do this, but events over 
took them. 
Even this petition was rejected and the Bill was rushed through 
the House in all its stages, for submission to Lord Ripon, for the Queen's ap-
proval. 
A second petition had, therefore, to be submitted through Sir Walter 
Hely-Hutchinson; vide "Petition to Lord Ripon", before 14-7-1894.
