21. APPLICATION FOR ENROLMENT AS ADVOCATE 
BOMBAY, 
November 16, 1891 
TO 
THE PROTHONOTARY AND REGISTRAR 
OF THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE 
BOMBAY 
SIR, 
I am desirous of being admitted as an Advocate of the High 
Court. I was called to the Bar in England on the 10th June 
last. 
I have kept twelve terms in the Inner Temple and I 
intend to practise in the Bombay Presidency. 
I produce the certificate of my being called to the Bar. As 
to the certificate of my character and abilities, I have not been 
able to obtain any certificate from a judge in England, for I was 
not aware of the rules in force in the Bombay High Court. I, 
however, produce a certificate from Mr. W. D. Edwards, a prac-
tising Barrister in the Supreme Court of Judicature in England. 
He is the author of the Compendium of the Law of Property in 
Land, one of the books prescribed for the Bar Final Examination. 
I beg to remain, 
Sir, 
Your most obedient servant, 
M.
