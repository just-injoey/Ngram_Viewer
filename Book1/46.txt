LETTER TO DADABHAI NAOROJI 
C/O 
MESSRS DADA ABDOOLA & 
CO., 
DURBAN, 
July 14, 1894 
TO 
THE HON. MR. DADABHAI NAOROJI, M.P. 
SIR, 
In continuation of my letter2 dated the 7th instant, I have 
to inform you of the progress of the movement against the Fran-
chise Law Amendment Bill as follows: 
The Bill passed the 3rd reading in the Legislative Council 
on the 7th instant. The other petition to the Council was ac-
cepted. One Hon. Member moved the postponement of the 3rd 
reading till the petition was considered by the House. The motion 
was rejected. 
The Governor has given his assent to the Bill subject to its 
being disallowed by Her Majesty. The Bill has a proviso in it that 
it shall not become law until, by a proclamation or otherwise, the 
Governor signifies that it is not Her Majesty's wish to disallow the 
Bill. 
I send you herewith a copy of the petition3 to the Home 
Government that will be sent to the Governor here probably on the 
17th instant. It will be signed by nearly 10,000 Indians. Nearly 
5,000 signatures have already been received. 
I regret to say that I am unable to send you a copy of the 
petition4 to the Council. I however beg to send a newspaper cutting 
which gives a fairly good report. 
1 Vice-President of the Natal Indian Congress, 1894-99 
2 This letter is not available. 
3 Vide the preceding item. 
4 Vide "Petition to Natal Legislative Council", 6-7-1894.

I do not think there remains anything more to be added. The 
situation is so critical that if the Franchise Bill becomes law, the 
position of the Indian 10 years hence will be simply intolerable 
in the Colony. 
I remain, 
Your obedient servant, 
M. K. 
GANDHI
