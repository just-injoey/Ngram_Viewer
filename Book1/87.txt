87. LETTER TO W. WEDDERBURN 
P. O. BOX 66, 
CENTRAL WEST STREET, 
DURBAN, NATAL, 
March 7, 1896 
SIR WILLIAM WEDDERBURN, BARONET, M.P., ETC. 
CHAIRMAN OF THE BRITISH COMMITTEE OF 
THE INDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS 
LONDON 
SIR, 
I venture to enclose herewith a cutting containing the Fran-
chise Bill that the Government proposes to introduce during the 
next session of the Legislative Assembly of Natal in April. This Bill 
replaces the Act of 1894 against which a Memorial1 was sent to the 
Government. It is said that this Bill has been approved of by Mr. 
Chamberlain. If so it would place the Indian community in a 
very awkward position. The newspapers seem to think that India 
has representative institutions and that therefore the Bill will not 
affect the Indians. At the same time there can be no doubt that 
the Bill is meant to affect the Indian community. It is our inten-
tion to oppose the Bill. But in the meantime a question in the 
House of Commons, in my humble opinion, may be very useful 
and give an insight into Mr. Chamberlain's views. The Indian 
community will soon have to encroach upon your time and atten-
tion on other matters of pressing importance. 
I beg to remain, 
Sir, 
Your obedient servant, 
M. K. GANDHI
