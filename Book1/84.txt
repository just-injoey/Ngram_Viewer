84. LETTER TO C. WALSH 
DURBAN, 
March 4, 1896 
C. WALSH, ESQ. 
ACTING SECRETARY FOR ZULULAND 
PIETERMARITZBURG 
SIR, 
I beg to acknowledge your letter dated 27th ultimo in reply to 
the Memorial1 about the Nondweni Township Regulations, which 
I had the honour to forward to His Excellency the Governor of 
Zululand, conveying the information that the Regulations are a 
copy of the Eshowe Township Regulations which were published 
during His Excellency's predecessor's time. 
Such being the case, I would, on behalf of the Memorialists, 
venture to request His Excellency to order the alteration or amend-
ment to the Regulations with regard to both the Townships, so as 
to do away with the colour distinction. In any case, I take the 
liberty to submit that the existence of similar Regulations for the 
Eshowe Township is, in my humble opinion, no justification for 
the Nondweni Township Regulations, regard 
being especially 
had to the events that are now happening concerning the position 
of the Indians as to property rights in other parts of South 
Africa. 
I believe there are no such Regulations for the Melmoth 
Township.2 
I beg, etc., 
M. K. GANDHI
