3. LETTER TO LAKSHMIDAS GANDHI 
LONDON, 
Friday, November 9, 1888 
RESPECTED BROTHER, 
I am sorry that there has been no letter from you for the last 
two or three weeks. 
Your silence is due perhaps to your not 
having heard from me. But it was impossible for me to post any 
letters before I reached London. That you should not have written 
to me on that account is indeed surprising. As I am far from 
home we can meet only through letters. 
And if I do not get 
letters I feel very much worried. 
Therefore please drop a post-
card every week without fail. I would not have been anxious if you 
did not have my address. But I am sorry that you have stopped 
writing after having written to me twice. 
I joined the Inner 
Temple on Tuesday last. I will write in detail after I hear from 
you next week. The cold here is now bitter but such bad weather 
generally does not last long. In spite of the cold I have no need 
of meat or liquor. This fills my heart with joy and thankfulness. 
I am now keeping very good health. Please give my respects to 
mother and sister-in-law.
