CENTRAL WEST STREET, 
DURBAN, NATAL, 
March 6, 1896 
THE SECRETARY FOR ZULULAND 
PIETERMARITZBURG 
SIR, 
May I enquire what led to the colour distinction being intro-
duced in the Eshowe Township Regulations, seeing that none 
such exists with regard to the Melmoth Township Regulations, 
and also the date when the Melmoth Township Regulations were 
published? 
I remain, etc., 
M. K. GANDHI
