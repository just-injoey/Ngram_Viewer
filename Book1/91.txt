1 On the presentation of this petition the second reading of the Bill was 
put off by another week and completed only on May 6. 
On May 18, the 
Bill was committed to a joint committee of the Legislatures which then had 
its third reading. 
The Governor then forwarded the Bill to the Secretary of State 
for Colonies for securing the Royal assent. 
Vide The Early Phase, pp. 609-15. 
2 Similar cables were sent to Wedderburn, Hunter and Dadabhai Naoroji. 
Writing on May 13, Hunter acknowledged the cable and promised "careful 
consideration on receipt of the Memorial". 
Hunter had interviewed Cham-
berlain a 
fortnight 
earlier and the latter had "expressed his 
sympathy 
but mentioned the difficulty of adding further elements of disturbance at the 
present moment to our complications 
in South Africa". 
"Justice will be 
done," Hunter added, but "somewhat slowly", as it was "mixed up in English 
opinion with the monotone of complaint made by the Indian Congress party 
... " Hunter concluded with the advice : "You have only to take up your 
position strongly in order to be successful" (S.N. 948). 
He wrote again on 
May 22 that the Secretary of State for the Colonies had assured that the Memo-
rial of the Natal Indians would receive his full consideration (S.N. 985). 
3 Acknowledging 
this 
cable, 
Dadabhai Naoroji 
wrote on May 21 
that Wedderburn had passed on the cable to him on behalf of the British 
Committee; referring to his correspondence with Chamberlain on the subject 
he observed, "I am glad that your Memorial will be considered and no action 
or decision will be taken before it is received or considered" (S.N. 973).
