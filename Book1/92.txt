LETTER TO PRIME MINISTER 
DURBAN, 
May 14, 1896 
TO 
THE HONOURABLE THE PRIME MINISTER 
PIETERMARITZBURG 
SIR, 
You are reported to have said the following with reference 
to the Natal Indian Congress on the Second Reading of the Fran-
chise Bill: 
Members might not be aware that there was in this country a body, 
a very powerful body in its way, a very united body, though practically 
a secret bodyâ€”he meant the Indian Congress. 
May I venture to enquire if that portion of your speech is 
correctly reported, and if so, whether there are any grounds for the 
belief that the Congress is 
"practically a secret body"? 
I may 
be permitted to draw your attention to the fact that when the in-
tention of forming such a body was made it was announced in the 
papers, that when it was actually formed its formation was notic-
ed by the Witness, that the annual report and list of members 
and rules have been supplied to and commented upon by the Press, 
and that these papers have also been supplied to the Government 
by me in my capacity as Honorary Secretary to the Congress.1 
I have the honour to remain, 
Sir, 
Your obedient servant, 
M. K. GANDHI 
HONORARY SECRETARY 
NATAL INDIAN CONGRESS 
From a copy: S.N. 981 
1 On May 16, C. Bird replied to this letter: In answer to your letter to 
the Prime Minister of the 14th instant, respecting certain words reported as 
having been made use of by him, on the Second Reading of the Franchise Bill, 
with reference to the Natal Indian Congress, I am desired by Sir John Robinson 
to state that speaking of that Congress as practically a secret body he did so 
under the belief that meetings of the Congress are not open to the public 
and the Press. If the Prime Minister has been misinformed on this point, I 
am to state that he will be glad to be corrected on the subject (S.N. 981).
