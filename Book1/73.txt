73. LETTER TO "THE NATAL MERCURY"1 
DURBAN, 
September 25, 1895 
TO 
THE EDITOR 
The Natal Mercury 
SIR, 
Your correspondent 
"H" has evidently been misinformed 
as to the genesis of the Natal Indian Congress, as also with regard 
to other matters. 
The Congress was formed chiefly by the efforts 
of Mr. Abdulla Hajee Adam. 
I have been present at all the 
meetings of the Congress, and I know that no Civil Servant has 
taken part in any of the meetings. 
The responsibility for drafting 
the rules and the several memorials rests entirely on my shoulders. 
Not one Civil Servant even saw the memorials before they were 
printed and ready for distribution among the Congress members 
and others. 
M. K. GANDHI 
HON. SEC., N.I.C.
