63. LETTER TO M. C. CAMROODEEN 
P. O. BOX 66, 
DURBAN, NATAL, 
May 5, 1895 
DEAR MR. MAHOMED CASSIM CAMROODEEN, 
I have received from you the signatures of the Indians. I hope 
you have obtained those of the Dutch and promptly sent them to 
Pretoria. There should be no delay in this, as the work is very 
urgent. I have wired to Pretoria also to send a copy of the Dutch 
petition there. All this should be completed by Wednesday. Please 
write to me in detail as to what you have done. 
It is very necessary that every Indian should exert himself to 
the utmost in this work. Otherwise, we shall have to repent.2 
Yours sincerely, 
MOHANDAS GANDHI
