17. 
SPEECH TO THE BAND OF MERCY, LONDON 
UPPER NORWOOD, 
[Before June 6, 1891] 
By previous arrangement . . . Mrs. McDouall . . . was to deliver a 
lecture to a meeting of the members of the Band of Mercy1, by the courtesy 
of Miss Seecombe, but she being ill, Mr. Gandhi (a Hindu from India) was 
requested and kindly consented to take the meeting. 
Mr. Gandhi spoke for 
about a quarter of an hour on vegetarianism from a humanitarian standpoint, 
and insisted that the members of the Band of Mercy, in order to be logical, 
ought to be vegetarians. 
He wound up with a quotation from Shakespeare.
