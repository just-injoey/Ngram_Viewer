18. 
SPEECH AT FAREWELL DINNER2 
June 11, 1891 
Although it was a sort of a farewell dinner, there was no sign of sorrow, 
because all felt that though Mr. Gandhi was going back to India, yet he was 
going to a still greater work for vegetarianism, and that upon the completion 
of his law career and his final success, congratulations to him should take the 
place of personal wailings. . . . 
At the close of the function, Mr. Gandhi, in a very graceful though some-
what nervous speech, welcomed all present, spoke of the pleasure it gave him 
to see the habit of abstinence from flesh progressing in England, related the 
manner in which his connection with the London Vegetarian Society arose, 
and in so doing took occasion to speak in a touching way of what he owed to 
Mr. Oldfield3. . . .

2 Held at Holborn 
3 Dr. Josiah Oldfield, editor of The Vegetarian 
42 
THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 
He also pointed to the hope that a future congress of the Federal Union 
would be held in India.
