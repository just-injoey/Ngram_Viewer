SPEECH AT ALFRED HIGH SCHOOL, RAJKOT3 
July 4, 1888 
I hope that some of you will follow in my footsteps, and after 
you return from England you will work wholeheartedly for big 
reforms in India.

1 When Gandhiji was 15, he had removed a bit of gold from his brother's 
armlet to clear a small debt of the latter. 
He felt so mortified about his act 
that he decided to make a confession to his father. 
Parental forgiveness was 
granted him in the form of silent tears. 
The incident left a lasting mark on 
his mind. 
In his own words, it was an object-lesson to him in the power 
of ahimsa. 
The original not being available; his own report of it, as found in An 
Autobiography, is reproduced here. 
2 According to Mahatma Gandhi: The Early Phase, p. 212, one of the 
sentences in the confession was: "So, father, your son is now, in your eyes, 
no better than a common thief." 
3 Gandhiji was given a send-off by his fellow-students of the Alfred High 
School, Rajkot, when he was leaving for England to study for the Bar. 
In 
An Autobiography, Pt. I, Ch. XI, he says: "I had written out a few words of 
thanks. 
But I could scarcely stammer them out. 
I remember how my head 
reeled and how my whole frame shook as I stood up to read them."
