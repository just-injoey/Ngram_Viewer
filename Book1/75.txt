LETTER TO "THE NATAL MERCURY"1 
DURBAN, 
September 30, 1895 
TO 
THE EDITOR 
The Natal Mercury 
SIR, 
Were the matter referred to in "H" 's letter in your Satur-
day issue concerning myself only, I would not have taken any 
notice, but as his letter affects Civil Servants I am obliged to tres-
pass further upon your courtesy. 
I am not a paid Secretary 
of the Congress. 
On the other hand, in common with other 
members, I also contribute my humble share to its funds. 
No 
one pays me anything whatever on behalf of the Congress. 
Some 
Indians do pay me yearly retainers. 
They are paid to me 
directly. 
There is nothing that the Congress has to conceal; 
only it does not blow its own trumpet. 
Any enquiries about it, 
whether public or private, will be answered as promptly as possible. 
I beg to enclose herewith some papers in connection with the 
Congress which would throw some light on its working. 
I am, etc., 
M. K. GANDHI 
HON. SEC., N.I.C. 
The Natal Mercury, 4-10-1895 
1 "H" had written again in The Natal Mercury, 28-9-1895, that it was the 
Indian interpreter that had framed the rules of the Congress, that he was 
mainly responsible for the submission of the Memorial to Her Majesty and also 
for Gandhiji's election as Congress Secretary on an annual salary of Â£300.
