LETTER TO "THE NATAL ADVERTISER" 
PRETORIA, 
September 16, 1893 
TO 
THE EDITOR 
The Natal Advertiser 
SIR, 
My attention has been drawn to the reproduction of Mr. 
Pillay's letter1 to The Transvaal Advertiser in your paper with com-
ments thereon. I am that unfortunate Indian barrister-at-law 
who had arrived in Durban, and who is now in Pretoria2; but 
I am not Mr. Pillay, nor am I a Bachelor of Arts. 
I am, etc., 
M. 
K.
