6. LETTER TO COL. J. W. WATSON 
[December, 1888] 
COLONEL J. 
W. 
WATSON  
POLITICAL AGENT 
KATHIAWAR 
DEAR SIR, 
It is about six or seven weeks since I landed in this country. 
By this time, I am comfortably settled and have fairly begun my 
studies. I have joined the Inner Temple for my legal course. 
You are well aware that English life is very expensive and, 
from what little experience I have had of it, I find that it is 
more so than I could persuade myself to believe while I was in 
India. My means as you know are very limited. I don't think I 
can go through a course of three years satisfactorily without some 
extraneous help. When I remember that you took a great deal 
of interest in my father and had extended your hand of friend-
ship to him, I have very little doubt that you will take the 
same interest in what concerns him and I feel confident that you 
will try your best to procure me some substantial help which 
would facilitate my course of study in this country. 
You will thus 
confer a great and much-needed obligation upon me. 
I saw Dr. Butler a few days ago. He is very kind to me and 
has promised to give me all assistance he can. 
The weather so far has not been very severe. 
I am doing 
very well. 
With best respects, 
I beg to remain, 
Dear Sir, 
Yours faithfully, 
M. K. GANDHI
